# 👥 Active Directory Account Creation (Windows Server Lab)

This script automates the creation of user accounts in Active Directory using a CSV file. It’s designed for IT administrators who need to bulk-create users quickly and consistently.

## ⚙️ What It Does: 
- Reads user data from a file called `Employees.csv`
- Creates Active Directory users with:
- First Name, Last Name, Username, Department, Job Title, and Password
- Sets the user password
- Adds users to an AD group based on their department
- Forces users to change their password at next login

### CSV Format
The `Employees.csv` file must include the following columns:

FirstName,LastName,Username,Password,Department,JobTitle
