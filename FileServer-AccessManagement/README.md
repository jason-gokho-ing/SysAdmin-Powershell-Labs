# üìÅ File Server & Access Management 

This lab demonstrates how to set up and manage a secure file server in a Windows Server domain environment using automation, NTFS permissions, Group Policy, and PowerShell scripting.

Simulates real-world Tier 2 System Administrator responsibilities.

## Lab Environment

| Component         | Name                         |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Domain Name       | `test-env.local`             |
| File Server       | `file-server.test-env.local` |
| Domain Controller | `dc-controller.test-env.local` |
| Clients           | Windows 10/11 workstations   |
| Groups            | `hr-group`, `it-group`, `accounting-group` |

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Shared Folder on File Server

- Create `C:\Shares` on the file server manually.
- Right-click ‚Üí **Properties ‚Üí Sharing ‚Üí Advanced Sharing**
- Share the folder with **Everyone ‚Äì Full Control**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:**\
> Although the share is open to "Everyone," access is strictly controlled using **NTFS permissions** for each subfolder (set in the script below).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run `create_folders.ps1` (Complete File Server Setup)

**This script performs both folder creation AND generates an audit report in one step:**

- Creates three subfolders inside `C:\Shares`:
  - `Accounting`, `IT`, `HR`
- Applies NTFS permissions:
  - `Domain Admins`: Full Control
  - Department group (e.g., `hr-group`): Modify
- Generates a permissions audit report automatically
- Saves report to: `C:\Scripts\FolderPermissions_Report.csv`

üìú NTFS Permissions Applied:
| Folder     | Group          | Rights       |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| HR         | `hr-group`     | Modify       |
| IT         | `it-group`     | Modify       |
| Accounting | `accounting-group` | Modify  |
| All folders | `Domain Admins` | Full Control |

> üîê Least privilege access enforced via NTFS  
> üìä Audit report automatically generated

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create GPO for Drive Mapping

- Open **Group Policy Management Console**
- Create GPO: `Map_Department_Shares`
- Under: `User Configuration > Preferences > Windows Settings > Drive Maps`

For each department:
- Map a network drive (e.g., H:\ for HR)
- Use **Item-Level Targeting** to assign based on group membership

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ View the Generated Audit Report

The `create_folders.ps1` script automatically generates a permissions report at:
- **Location**: `C:\Scripts\FolderPermissions_Report.csv`
- **Contents**: All NTFS permissions for each department folder
- **Fields**: Folder, User_or_Group, Access_Level, Permission_Type
